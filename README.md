# Object-Oriented-Programming-cpp-days

Welcome to my Pool project at school 1337! This project is designed to help me learn the basics of C++ programming,
as well as object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

The project consists of daily challenges that I've added to my Github repository.
These challenges are designed to help me build my C++ skills and become more familiar with OOP concepts.
